Steps:
<br>
1. The main objective is to create a sales report for ATLIQ HARDWARE by using TABLEAU. 
<br>
2. At first I wrote some SQL queries in MYSQL as it is the database.
<br>
3. Then I used Tableau to pull the data from MYSQL.
<br>
4. Then I made vizualizations for total revenue, sales quantity, top 5 customes by revenue, top 5 products by revenue, profit trends by market and revenue by market. 
<br>
5. All these visuals can be controlled with filters by date, quater, month and other amounts. 
<br>
The main motive of the project was to determine the KPIs as well as to detect the trending customes of the company.
